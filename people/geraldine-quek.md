Dr. Geraldine Quek, Ph.D., is a Faculty Early Career Award (FECA) Fellow in the Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) pillar at SUTD. Geraldine's research seeks to advance knowledge on the interaction of light and occupants’ psychological and physiological responses in buildings toward healthy and comfortable occupant-centric building designs. She aims to research further into improving lighting conditions in Singapore’s healthcare spaces towards improved well-being, recovery rates and stress restoration for patients and healthcare workers through visual and non-visual light responses. 

Geraldine recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Architecture and Sciences of the City from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, where she worked on improving visual comfort prediction models for indoor daylit conditions at the Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design (LIPID) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Marilyne Andersen and Dr. Jan Wienold. Previously, she worked as a research assistant studying daylighting in office, residential and education buildings in the tropics with Prof. Dr. Alstan Jakubiec at the Design for Climate and Comfort Lab in SUTD, where she also obtained her B.Sc and M.Arch with distinction in Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) as one of the pioneering students.
